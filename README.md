Repository script internship Zedda Giovanni (0negip)

To use the scripts present in the repository, the processed HUMMUS CSV files (found in the "data preprocess" folder of the HUMMUS repository) and the OFF ontology file (which I believe can be found on the wiki) are required. These should be placed in a new folder in the root directory of the repository called "csv_file".
