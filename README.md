# KGEats
Zedda Giovanni's Internship Repository (0negip)

## Description

KGEats is a project that aims to create the most complete food-themed ontology ever and investigate new ways to perform entity linking and user-related attribute extraction by exploiting LLMs.

## Installation and use

1) pip install -r requirements.txt
2) To use the scripts present in the repository, the processed HUMMUS CSV files (found in the "data preprocess" folder of the HUMMUS repository) and the OFF ontology file (which can be found on the off wiki) are required. These should be placed in a new folder in the root directory of the repository called "csv_file".
3) You need to generate the required file by going to the directory of the analysis and file creation files and run the jupyters related to the creation of the files and the LLMs
4) Next you need to normalize the datasets and extract the attributes inferred by the users using jupyter in the root directory called pipeline
5) Finally you can run jupyter main to create the merged ontology
