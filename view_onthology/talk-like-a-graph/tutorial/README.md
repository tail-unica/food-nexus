### Overview

Graphs are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing complex relationships
in real-world applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities by advancing state-of-the-art on many language-based
benchmarks. Their ability to process and understand natural language open
exciting possibilities in various domains. Despite the remarkable progress in
automated reasoning with natural text, reasoning on graphs with LLMs remains an
understudied problem that has recently gained more attention.

This tutorial builds upon recent advances in expressing reasoning problems
through the lens of tasks on graph data. The first part of the tutorial will
provide an in-depth discussion of techniques for representing graphs as inputs
to LLMs. The second, hands-on, portion will demonstrate these techniques in a
practical setting.

### Schedule

This talk is being given at [KDD 2024](https://kdd2024.kdd.org/) at 2pm in room
P1 122-123 at the Centre de Convencions Internacional de Barcelona.
